<h2>Information</h2>
<p>There are a total of ten classes in Dark Souls III. Then with each class there are
 different presets and abilities. If you are a new player then for most games that are
 atleast similar to this you want to start with the knight. The knight class is the easiest
 to master and maintain. If you were a veteran to the game then you would probably go for 
 the deprived. The deprived is a minimalist character you start off with almost nothing and
 very bsic equpment.</p>
 
 <h2>Stats</h2>
 <p>In addition to having different equpment they all have different stats. There are a total
 of ten stats and as you level up you place points into them according to your class. For example
 a knight would more than likely want to place most of their points in streangth, dextarity, and 
 vitality. The reason for this is so that they have high sustainability in addition to being able
 handle heavy sheilds and swords. As for a sorcerer you would need to place those points in
 intelligence, faith, and attunement. All of those contribut to the level and sevarity of the spell
 that they cast.</p>
 
 <h2>Conclusion</h2>
 <p>So to pick between all of these classes and how to build them can either take up a lot of time to
 reserch or to just understand how each one would benifite eachother. I would recomend the later because
 in the end you are more succesful and your character is exactally how you would want it. Instead of 
 emulating another persons preferences of theirs.</p>
