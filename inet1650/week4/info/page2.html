<h1>Bosses</h1>

<h2>Main bosses</h2>
<p>There are a total of 19 bosses in the game and all of them are very difficult to
defeat wspecially if you do not know what you are doing. It also matters how you defeat
them and in what order becuse it affects the story. If you used the help of one of the
friends you acquired through the story it would make it easier on top of going through 
that branch of the story. So you have to think carfully when deciding what to do with 
almost every action.</p>

<h2>Mini Bosses</h2>
<p>The mini bosses are just a bunch of characters that are hard to beat but have little 
to do with the main story. Except they all give you either a lot of money of some special
item. That item usually leads to onother boss or its a very powerfull weapon or peice of 
armor. Which in turn those items ultimatly affect your game play but if you jsut decide 
to not fight them there will be no significant impact to the game.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>So in the end the bosses can either make or break the game. They can be too hard to 
beat and you give up or they're too easy and you lose interest. It is very difficult to 
acquire the right level so that the game is properly balanced and fun. I belive that this
game is on the difficult side but thats also what makes the game so entertaining.</p>
