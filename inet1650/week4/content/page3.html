<h2>Weapons</h2>
<p>Each class has their own preference for weapons. As for the knight it can either be a
sheild and a one handed sword or it can be a two handed sword. Both have their strengths and
weaknesses but it all depends on what you prefer. The one handed sword is faster and can be
swung more times with out stopping but it does less damage. The two handed sword does more 
damage but its slower and ultimatly can be swung fewer times, but it has a stun effect so if you
time it right they won't be able to move. Then for  a sorcerer they want a staff and a talisman 
of a sheild. They want a sheild because they have low health and the talisman so they can cast
their spells.</p>

<h2>Armor</h2>
<p>Armor significantly effects on how much damage and mobility for each character. A knight is
slower but can take a lot more damage. As for a theif they can move fast enough that if you move
at the right times you will not get hit but along with light armor they have daggers wich don't do
much damage. Armor can also protect more of a certain type of attack but in turn they are usually 
vulnerable in a different area. So armor is a key aspect in any game not just this one.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Both armor and what weapons you decide are best for your class greatly impact how you will play the
game. It also will either make the game easier or harder. Usually you would want to make the game easier 
unlsess you were messing around and just having fun with low level enimies. Every decision will affect how
this game is played and your opinion of it.</p>
