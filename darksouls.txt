<p>Dark Souls is a game that is set in the third person perspective and players 
are given a variety of weapons to fight against the enemies. There are also 
bonfires which serve as <mark>check points</mark> where the player can save the game and 
<em>refill their health.</em> Although you always <var>seem</var> to <sup>die</sup> and it's really frustrating.
<del>This game is really fun. </del></p>

their thrones. Then enters the main character <strong>(you)</strong> and your job is to return
all of the <sub>lords</sub> back to their thrones. The only way to get them to come back
is defeaing them in battle.</p>
